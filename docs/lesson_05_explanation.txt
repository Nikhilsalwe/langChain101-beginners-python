Lesson 05: Agents and Tools

IMPORTS AND SETUP
```python
from langchain import llms
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import agent, get_all_tool_names, initialize_agent, load_tools
```

PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces LangChain agents and tools, demonstrating how to combine different tools (Wikipedia and Calculator) to solve complex queries that require multiple steps.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Tool Loading:
   ```python
   tools = load_tools(["wikipedia", "llm-math"], llm=llms)
   ```

2. Agent Initialization:
   ```python
   agent = initialize_agent(tools, llms, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
   ```

3. Complex Query Processing:
   - The agent can break down complex queries into steps
   - Uses different tools as needed
   - Shows reasoning process with verbose output

CODE EXPLANATION:
- load_tools() loads specific tools (Wikipedia and Calculator)
- initialize_agent() creates an agent that can use these tools
- "zero-shot-react-description" agent type can decide which tool to use
- verbose=True shows the agent's reasoning process

EXAMPLE USAGE:
```python
prompt = "what was the 3rd president of the United States born? what is that year raised to the power of 3?"
agent.run(prompt)
```

The agent:
1. Uses Wikipedia to find Jefferson's birth year
2. Uses Calculator to compute the mathematical operation
3. Shows step-by-step reasoning

This lesson demonstrates how agents can combine different tools to solve complex queries that require multiple steps and different types of operations.
