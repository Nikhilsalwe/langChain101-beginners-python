Lesson 03: Prompt Templates and Chains

IMPORTS AND SETUP
```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms import OpenAI
```

PURPOSE:
This lesson introduces prompt templates and chains, demonstrating how to create structured, reusable prompts and chain them with language models.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. PromptTemplate:
   - Creates a reusable template with variables
   - Allows for consistent prompt structure
   ```python
   template = "You are a naming consultant for new companies. What is a good name and suggest 5 name for a company that makes {product}?"
   prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
   ```

2. LLMChain:
   - Combines a prompt template with an LLM
   - Creates a reusable chain for similar queries
   ```python
   chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
   ```

CODE EXPLANATION:
- PromptTemplate.from_template() creates a template with variables (marked by {})
- Variables can be filled in at runtime
- LLMChain combines the template and LLM into a single, reusable unit
- chain.run() executes the chain with provided variables

EXAMPLE USAGE:
```python
# Run the chain with a specific product
print(chain.run("colorful socks"))
```

This lesson shows how to create more structured and reusable prompts, making it easier to maintain consistency in AI interactions and reduce repetitive code.
