Lesson 06: Human Input Tool

IMPORTS AND SETUP
```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import agent, initialize_agent, load_tools
```

PURPOSE:
This lesson demonstrates how to incorporate human input into the agent's workflow, allowing for interactive problem-solving sessions.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. Human Tool Loading:
   ```python
   tools = load_tools(["human"])
   ```

2. Agent Setup:
   ```python
   agent = initialize_agent(tools, llms, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
   ```

CODE EXPLANATION:
- The human tool allows the agent to ask questions to the user
- Uses zero-shot-react-description agent type
- verbose=True shows the reasoning process
- Agent can interact with user when it needs additional information

EXAMPLE USAGE:
```python
prompt = "what is the surname name of my friend Swastik?"
agent.run(prompt)
```

The agent will:
1. Recognize it doesn't have the information
2. Use the human tool to ask the user
3. Process the response and provide an answer

This lesson shows how to create interactive AI systems that can request clarification or additional information from users when needed.
